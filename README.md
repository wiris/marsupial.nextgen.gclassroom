# Marsupial NextGen Google Classroom connector

This project is a sample app that acts as an [LTI Advantage](https://www.imsglobal.org/lti-advantage-overview) platform that interfaces between an LTI 1.3 tool and Google Classroom to allow posting and launching LTI resources from Google Classroom.

The features it supports are:

* Sign in using your Google account.
* Work with multiple LTI tools.
* Teachers can use the Deep Linking protocol to select the LTI resource to be shared from inside the app.
* Resources are automatically posted as Assignments or Materials in Google Classroom.
* For graded assignments and LTI tools that support the Assignment and Grades Service extension, grades are automatically pushed to Google Classroom.

This is a sample project that can act as a base for the creation of an enterprise app to provide the features described above after branding and customization. It is not intended for direct production usage.

This project will become obsolete if Google provides a direct integration of the LTI protocol inside Google Classroom but they have not announced plans to do so at the moment of this release.

This project has been developed by [WIRIS](https://www.wiris.com) as part of the [Marsupial NextGen](https://marsupialnextgen.edutechcluster.org/) project which has been funded by the Spanish Government.
